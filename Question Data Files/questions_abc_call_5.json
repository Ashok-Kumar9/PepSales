    "question": "What else beyond validating those two points as far as the data tests, do you need to see in order to feel confident in xyz?",
    "answer": "No, I think that'd be a good start. I'm sure I'll have questions, as we get into it, but would just like to see what you had planned here.",
    "rating": "Good"
  },
  {
    "question": "How does this compare with like how you would currently decide where to allocate spend, where to double?",
    "answer": "Yeah. I mean the whole reason I've been researching ABM is really to get more precise in what we're doing and we've done some efforts in it again using iq via and their last product but they're not, they're really Strong at position personas and physician leadership, but there's a lot of people in healthcare than our physicians that make decisions. And so... I've been looking for basically something like this. It, it would absolutely make us more Targeted in our approach.",

  },
  {
    "question": "How did we do on that front?",
    "answer": "Still on the end front? I mean, that's a tool that I really have not leveraged before. So, you know, I guess I don't have a full understanding of how that compares in the market. I contact stuff. I would like to just dig into a little bit more, and look at an account or two, and I know that kind of that, you know, just throw a random account out there. It's not what you guys like to do. But, I would just like to understand how I would get in there or anyone on our team would get in there and review an account.",

  },
  {
    "question": "Do you have a sense of where you're leaning?",
    "answer": "I mean, you know, I don't know that it's fair, to them because I haven't like really done a deep dive into theirs but, they limit the scope of like what you can track. I get more with the marketing side of it than you would get with the sales side of it, Brian. But... yeah, they're just differences and nuances. And, I just don't know enough to say like I mean, right now, I just solve more from you than I have from anybody. So you're leader in the clubhouse because I know more... but, you know, we were talking with tech target, you know, a while ago when we were just starting to do research on this. So, I wouldn't need to go back and revisit conversations with them too.",
    "rating": "Good"
  },
  {
    "question": "Is there like a specific timeline in which you're looking to?",
    "answer": "Some, yeah, I, Brian wants to move quick. I want to move quick but, you know, it more directly impacts him and I want to make sure we're making the right decision so that one side is not negatively impacting the other two, three months down the road. So that's my goal.",
    "rating": "Good"
  },
  {
    "question": "Given budget is top of mind like, as we work towards putting that proposal together, like does it make sense for us to put an incentivized proposal together, for June and moving forward by then?",
    "answer": "I think that's something that, and I can talk about with regard to what that timeline looks like. We probably will just want to sync on it. I would say yes, but again, this has to be a right decision for all parties here. So... and I can sync on that. I mean, I don't know who would want to be on that call but I can make some time this week to just make sure that I'm comfortable with kind of a dive into an account and what those workflows look like and how to manipulate, and create those maps and whatnot.",
